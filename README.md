I wanted to read his essays on my kindle, there was no way to download the pdfs of 200+ essays, wrote this quick script to make pdfs of all of them and store in a folder called pdfs. You can then transfer them over to your kindle. This is using a library, and some multiprocessing to speed it up. Be aware of running it on low powered systems.
